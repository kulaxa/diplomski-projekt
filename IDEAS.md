# Seminar Ideas
- seperate physics from graphics

## 1. General performance testing system for application
### Features
1. Plugin to application
2. Create runtime data that can be graphed. Time, performance, different settings
3. End to end unit tests -> How simular is result to control or to something else

-> terminal based, script at first, low effort, POC


## 2. Optimize CPU algorithm further

## 3. Write CPU algoritm for GPU
